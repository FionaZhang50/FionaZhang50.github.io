        I am a student at the University of Southern California studying Computer Science who is interested in the intersectionality of art and computer science. Ever since I was young I have always
        been a visual artist, drawing characters and scenery. Then in high school, I discovered computer science, a new skill and form of language 
        that also allowed me to express myself but in a different way. Computer science provided me with the skills to create new products and my own projects, such as a game 
        program, a calculator, machine learning applications, and a website. Besides art and computer science, I also enjoy reading, playing badminton, and watching movies.

      I am a student from the Bay Area who is interested in art and computer science. Ever since I was young I have always
        been a visual artist, drawing, doodling, sketching, and painting, characters and scenery. I enjoyed art as a creative outlet and I have kept art in my life through
        attending art lessons while working on my own art at the same time. However once I reached high school, I discovered computer science, a new skill and form of language 
        that also allowed me to express myself but in a different way. Computer science provided me with the skills to create new products and my own projects, such as a game 
        program, a calculator, machine learning applications, and a website. Besides art and computer science, I also enjoy reading, playing badminton, and watching movies.
